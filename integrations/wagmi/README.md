# Wagmi Demo App

A reference implementation of [Metamask's Wagmi connector](https://github.com/wevm/wagmi/blob/main/packages/connectors/src/metaMask.ts) and a port of [Wagmi's React Playground](https://github.com/wevm/wagmi/tree/main/playgrounds/vite-react).

## Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps on the root [README](../../README.md) first.

- `yarn dev` to run the app in localhost.
- `yarn dev --host` to run and listen on all addresses, including LAN and public IP (useful for mobile physical devices)
